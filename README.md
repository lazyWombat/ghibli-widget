## Ghibli widget

This is a d3 exercise. The project combines d3, typescript, webpack together to come up with a widget.

## Usage

### Running the project

```sh
yarn start
```

### Creating a production build

```sh
yarn build
```

The browser window opens automatically and the widget starts working.

## Details

The typescript / webpack combo is taken from https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter

All React libraries are thrown away to limit the size of the build.
